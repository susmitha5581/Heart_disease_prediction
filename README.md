"Heart disease is broad term used for diseases and conditions affecting the heart and circulatory system. They are also referred as cardiovascular diseases. It is a major cause of disability all around the world. Since heart is amongst the most vital organs of the body, its diseases affect other organs and part of the body as well. There are several different types and forms of heart diseases. The most common ones cause narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, malfunctioning in the valves of the heart, enlargement in the size of heart and several others leading to  **heart failure and heart attack."**

## **Problem**

World Health Organization has estimated 12 million deaths occur worldwide, every year due to Heart diseases. Half the deaths in the United States and other developed countries are due to cardio vascular diseases. The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high risk patients and in turn reduce the complications. This research intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using logistic regression.

## **Solution**

The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).

I have implemented Logistic Regression Model to predict Coronary Heart Disease.
